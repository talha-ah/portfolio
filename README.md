# TO DO

- [ ] Start the website with light off, and a torch or candle and ask the user to use it to navigate the website.
      '''
      I know it's not a good user experience to hide the content by default but we are not here for user experience but I want to impress the user with the creativity.
      '''
- [ ] Add a button to switch on/off the light.
