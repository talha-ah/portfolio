# THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO WRITING A GREAT TECH CV

## INTRODUCTION

‘One page looks like you have nothing to say about yourself. Two pages are good. Three is maximum. Anything beyond three usually goes into the bin. Honestly.’ COVID has forced many great tech people back into an extremely competitive job market. If you’re looking for a new job, possibly for the first time in a few years, it’s okay to be unsure about a few things. Take CVs. You might not have written one since first starting out in the industry, like most you just keep adding jobs to it as you go without thinking about the readability or relevance of it to potential hiring managers. You think you know what you do, but trends and tastes change. What worked ten years ago may look outdated now.

In this eBook, we’re going to give you an up-to-the-minute guide on how to write a great tech CV. We’ll include their quotes scattered throughout, in yellow, straight from the horse’s mouth. We asked some of the best hiring managers in tech about their turn-ons, turn-offs and more when it comes to CVs.

‘ I’m always looking to find out what the candidate has actually done, not what the team or company has.’

They said that the top four things they look for in a tech CV were:

To make it easy to follow, there’s a page of tips for each section of your CV, starting with the layout and the contact details at the top, moving through skills and experience, finishing with hobbies and interests.

- Most recent tech stack
- Details of most recent projects and the impact the candidate had on the projects.
- Proven commitment to self-development / personal projects
- Solid work history / non job hopper / no large gaps

We’ve added some other nuggets of gold for you too. I hope that if you’re looking for a new role right now, or just want to make sure your CV is sparkling, you will find all the insight you need right here. Let’s go.

## LAYOUT

The hiring manager or recruiter for your dream job has a pile of CVs sitting on their desk - and very little time to read them. If your CV isn’t easy to read, it’s going straight in the bin. Harsh but true. You must lay out your CV to help the reader find all the information they want, as quickly as possible. Firstly, keep it simple. That means stay away from crazy designs, logos and photos. Use a clean and simple font, large enough to read easily. Put space between your sections to clearly separate them. Don’t bunch everything together. Also, you shouldn’t need more than 2-3 pages. If you have lots of experience, concentrate on the last 4-5 years. The rule of thumb is – the more recent the experience, the more you write about it.

‘What puts me off a CV? Anything longer than two to three pages.’

Next, highlight the most important information. Your hiring manager may only be skimming your CV at first – make sure they see what makes you unique. Head up your roles with bold titles. You should also use bold type for your most outstanding achievements. Don’t go over the top with this though. Finally, pay attention to detail. If your CV is riddled with spelling mistakes and poor grammar, your hiring manager will probably judge you negatively. With so much tech out there to check your spelling and tidy up your grammar, there is no excuse not to use it. I use Grammarly. Don’t use loads of words where one or two will do. You want to come over as efficient and focused, not someone who goes around the houses.

‘I don’t like to see spelling or punctuation mistakes. CVs should also be concise – not wordy.’

## CONTACT DETAILS & LINKS

One of the things that always baffles me is when candidates don’t put their contact details on their CV. I’m an effective recruiter, but I’m not a magician! Your CV will be passed from recruiter to hiring manager. Then, it might travel from person to person in the company. Make it easy for anyone who wants to contact you about it. For tech candidates, several details are essential:

- Name – (obviously)
- Email address – Make sure your email address is professional looking. That hotdog69@hotmail.com address you got when you were 15 definitely does not count as professional!
- Phone number – Mobile only.
- LinkedIn – If you are going to share your LinkedIn details, make sure your profile looks professional and shows you in your best light. Remove any negative posts or replies to other people.
- Stack Overflow/GitHub – If you share your code on these platforms, shout about it on your CV. It shows you care about development.
- Your website – It’s a great thing to have a website to display your development portfolio and any technical blogging you like to do. Make sure it looks good, is relevant to your role and is easy to navigate.
- Location – No one needs your full address, but your location is crucial for hiring managers and recruiters with roles that aren’t 100% remote. You don’t need to put your date of birth on there, but you can if you wish.

## OPENING STATEMENT

‘A concise and punchy opening statement always gets my attention. It often saves me a lot of time.’ Think of the opening statement of your CV like the blurb on the back of a book in a bookshop. It’s there to tempt you in, get you intrigued and make you buy the book. Write an opening statement that, in around eight lines, makes the hiring manager want to find out more about you. Start with a sentence on the sort of developer you are – e.g. full-stack, team leader. Give them a taste of your achievements – what are you most proud of? Move on to your key skills – e.g. coding languages, the sort of projects you primarily work on. Finally, when you write your statement, be clear and concise. Also, what makes you…well, you. What’s the specialism/superpower/secret sauce, that makes you valuable?

Don’t use a load of words for the sake of it. It turns off hiring managers and wastes valuable CV real estate. Next, some information on the type of role you are looking for – e.g. looking for a leadership role, or a role using a specific new technology.

‘Something that instantly puts me off a CV? When someone tries to hit buzzwords, or ticks off a checklist of items they think I want to see.’

Try and demonstrate the kind of person you are too (in a professional sense). Give them a sense of what it’s like to work with you.

## CAREER ACHIEVEMENTS

This is a part of your CV where you have to use a bit of judgment. If you’re looking for your first tech role and you don’t have enough career achievements to warrant a whole section, focus on demonstrating your potential another way.

‘At that level, experience isn’t so relevant. It’s about fit.’ ‘We’re assessing potential. Can you show that?’

‘Explain why this is your chosen career path: if moving from a different career, why? How are you going to work as part of a team, if you have been a bedroom developer. Contribute on stack overflow and open source projects.’

If you can't demonstrate anything relevant to the role you’re applying for, skip this section and move straight to skills. On the other hand, if you’re an industry veteran, you might have too many achievements to list! Don’t try to include everything – pick out the highlights.

‘Be concise with your career highlights. Show that you have good tech exposure.’ ‘Pick a recent project you have been passionate about and focus on that.’

## SKILLS

This is the part of your CV where you can get creative. I’ve seen some brilliant CVs in my time where candidates use colors, graphs, bar charts and more. If it’s clear, concise and gives the reader an understanding of your skills in seconds, it will work. What hiring managers really want to see here is that you can use the technologies that they run in their company right now. Invariably you won’t have all the skills for the role, but demonstrating that you are a quick learner who cares about new tech, goes a long way to getting past this. Don’t waste time listing technologies that are out of date, even if you were brilliant with them! The space on your CV is too valuable.

**Backend** – C# / Node.js / Ruby

‘I don’t like it when candidates list a lot of technologies to bulk out their CV. Also, I would worry about a developer who lists Microsoft Office on their CV. And HTML is not a programming language!’

**Architectures** – Microservices / SOA / Monolith

There are two approaches I recommend. Firstly, breaking your skills into a tech stack style, but making the ones you are strongest in first on the list and in bold. Like this:

**Frontend** – VueJS / Angular / React / Knockout **Databases** – SQL Server / DynamoDB **Cloud** – Azure / AWS **DevOps** – Azure DevOps / Jenkins / Octopus Deploy / Semaphore CI **Methodologies** – TDD / BDD / SOLID / Scrum / Kanban **Other Tools** – Github

Another route is to break your skills into competency levels:

**Specialist** – C# / Angular / TDD **Very Experienced** – NodeJS / VueJS / SQL Server / Azure / BDD / SOLID / Microservices **Competent** – Ruby / DynamoDB / Azure DevOps / Jenkins **Beginner** – AWS / Octopus Deploy / Semaphore CI Whatever you decide, it just needs to be clear and relevant. Find a way that works for you.

## EXPERIENCE

‘I need to see detail in descriptions of work.’

On a CV, you don’t describe your previous jobs just to tell hiring managers what you did; you do it to show them what you achieved. Use it to paint a picture, to create excitement about working with you. Give the hiring manager a taste of what you could achieve if they’re smart enough to hire you. Sometimes it’s hard to sell yourself – but now is the time, if ever there was one! Your CV is your value proposition – a glimpse of how you will make a difference in your new role. First up, what not to do – you don’t need to write about every job you’ve ever had, particularly if you’ve been around the block a few times. The more recent the experience, the more you should write.

You don’t need to write about why you left each job either. It never looks good and takes up valuable space. Save it for the interview or let your recruiter explain this. Here’s a format that I like:

- 1-2 sentences about the company and what they were trying to achieve.
- The projects you were involved with. What type of projects?
- What was your specific impact on these projects? What did you achieve? What were the results of your input? (e.g. financial, efficiency, customer retention, new business)
- Any other great stuff about you in this role, that sells you as a person.
- End with the specific tech stack for the role, so hiring managers can see what you were using most recently Be specific if you can. If a project you were instrumental on saved your company 500,000, put it down. Also, think about what makes you different from the other people competing for the role. Did you mentor new starters? Do you solve a problem that no one else had even noticed?

‘Experience is important, but you also need to show a willingness to develop and learn new technology, as well as a good attitude.’

## EXPERIENCE (EXAMPLES)

Here are some ways I’ve seen achievements written well on a tech CV. This shows the hiring manager that you are an achiever, you have impact and can solve the types of problems that they could be having right now.

‘I created a new purchasing application for 35+ branches to allow them to order stock more efficiently, saving the company 6,150 hrs per year in admin time and over 500k in stock valuation by moving to a ‘just in time’ ordering strategy.’

‘Achieved a 50% reduction in time taken to resolve critical issues by implementing an incident management process. The data collected allowed us to identify high-value development items to integrate into our technical roadmap.’

‘Implemented 85% reduction of downtime during deployment, from over 3 hours to sub 30 minutes, whilst driving a strategy to achieve zero downtime.’

‘Saved the equivalent of 12 days per month by leading a complex delivery pipeline and environment project which allowed our developers to develop in a safe environment that mimicked our complex, data-heavy, multi-cloud hybrid live environment. This was coupled with the automation of testing, replication and delivery.’

‘I successfully delivered the companies first scalable .NET Core Microservice designed to archive millions of passenger emails daily into Azure Blob storage, which resulted in reduced storage costs both internally and for our customers.’

‘Developed and implemented an agile & iterative technical strategy, to dramatically reduce the release cycle time, by championing the componentisation of the legacy platform, utilising Docker containerization and Kubernetes orchestration.’

‘I reduced the time to manually recover essential email notifications from hours to seconds, saving the company loads of staff-hours and enabling our customers to get a response almost instantly.’

‘Achieved 90% reduction of build times, from over 25 to under 3 minutes, through constant improvements in architecture, processes and tooling.’

## EIGHT

## EDUCATION

Education is another one of those sections on a CV which is more or less important depending on how established you are in the industry. If you’re a fresh graduate looking for your first role, you need to play up your level of education, as it’s all you have. Be proud of your degree; put it near the top of your CV. You can even list some of the modules you studied, if they’re relevant for the role you’re applying for.

‘If you completed a project during your degree, expand on that as if it was your last job.’

If you’ve taken courses or taught yourself any skills that are relevant to the role, such as additional programming languages, make sure you detail them under education. As well as showing that you have those skills, it shows that you have a great attitude and love to learn. However, if you got your degree more than ten years ago, put it near the bottom. (You can still be proud though!) Otherwise, your recent experience is much more important than what you did when you were 21.

‘Irrelevant detailon a CV is a turn-off. You still see people putting their exact GCSE grades down – when they’re 35!’

## HOBBIES AND INTERESTS

It’s a bit of a hot topic in the recruitment industry whether or not candidates should put their hobbies and interests on their CV. Some people think it’s not relevant and a waste of valuable space. I don’t. I like to find out about what people are into when I’m trying to place them in a role. If I see that a candidate has the same hobbies as a hiring manager, I’ll always mention it. It can start a conversation where you can show off more about what makes you unique. It can make the interview a lot more enjoyable. Plus, hiring managers often make a priority of hiring for fit. After all, you’re a human first, not a list of responsibilities and technologies. It only takes a couple of sentences to give a hiring manager a little insight about your mentality as a person. Plus, I think it helps me make better matches. When I see someone’s interests on a CV, it means I can personalize my approach and show that I’m not a cut ‘n’ paste merchant!

‘Make yourself interesting!’

## DIFFERING EXPERIENCE LEVELS

The content on your CV depends on what stage you’re in your career.

‘Code as much as possible. Show passion and self-investment.’

After all, your goals are different when you’re just starting out in the industry, compared to someone with ten years’ experience. Also, focus on what makes you stand out as a person. It could be the one thing that gets your CV off the ‘maybe’ pile and into the ‘must-see’ pile. If you’re looking for your first role, when it comes to skills and experience, there isn’t much that separates you from the crowd.

‘There’s more to you than programming. What is it?’

What makes you unique is the stuff you’ve done outside of education – those little extra things you did to get ahead. Complete some personal projects and put them on GitHub. Then, list them on your CV.

For mid-level developers looking to make the jump up to leadership, you need to tailor your CV to show hiring managers that you have what it takes. In this situation, it’s about going beyond programming. If you reduced staff churn by 50% in your last role, mention it.

‘I want to see qualities like taking ownership of projects, mentoring junior team members, assistance in writing specifications and scoping.’

When you’ve been in the industry for many years, your programming experience speaks for itself. So, hiring managers need to see something extra. The more senior you are, the more your CV needs to show that you see the bigger picture from a business perspective. If you reduced the number of bugs reaching the live system by 95%, put it down.

‘Adapt your CV and work history to what’s relevant to the role you’re applying for.’

## HIRING MANAGER ADVICE FOR DEVS

Here’s an assortment of the best quotes from hiring across the South of England:

‘I don’t like big gaps in between jobs, job hopping, a too detailed list of technologies and listing obvious and expected skills (Windows 10, Microsoft Office).’

‘Not a fan of flowery hype as way of an introduction, or an introduction devoid of actual real achievements.’

‘A concise and punchy opening statement always gets my attention. Often saves me a lot of time.’

(Advice for Grads / Juniors) ‘(a) Be realistic about what you can offer and aim for **now** but try and illustrate what you can offer for the future (i.e. what’s your potential - realize that that’s a different thing to “where do you want to be in 5 years?”) (b) Target roles which are small/well defined - a good manager will recognize potential and provide opportunities to grow & develop. (c) Make sure you have a good grasp of supportive knowledge e.g. design patterns etc., rather than just the tech/coding side - most of the “art” of software development is in the design/ architecture rather than the coding.

In reality not everyone has the freedom to do things like create apps in their spare time so whilst interesting if they have done it, I don’t place too much value on it.’

‘Show evidence that they want to learn and will be easy to mold. That they’ll make a good team player and not code in isolation. They’re aware of testing methodologies and will write solid code.’

‘Not to focus on the years experience, but what the candidate is doing to drive themselves forwards (proactively learning, own projects, exposure to and demonstrable understanding of fundamentals).’

(Advice for a mid-senior level) ‘They should have worked substantively on projects that actually went live. So they could experience the feedback cycle that comes with that, experience maintenance periods and reflect upon successes/ failures. This reflection is easier to identify in interview but the potential for it can be seen in a CV that talks about working on process improvement, making positive change within their team and company.’

## TWELVE

## CONCLUSION

‘I try to keep my CV to two pages with most space saved for the last two roles. These reflect my most recent abilities and growth. Further historical detail and education can be light touch – my LinkedIn profile can fill in the gaps. Concise bullet points prompt discussion on the phone or in person.’ I hope this eBook has helped you get an idea about what hiring managers are looking for from tech CVs nowadays. It’s a competitive job market, but a well-constructed CV can help you get ahead of the crowd. At Odd Shoes, we’re always here to answer any of your questions about writing an excellent tech CV.
