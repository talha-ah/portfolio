#### Description

Electromatic Works is a platform designed for a local business by providing the users the ability to contact the business by providing a list of products they are interested in without having to create an account. The platform was developed using React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I was working as a Full-Stack Developer. While working on this project, I was responsible for the development of the web application and the backend of the platform. The client asked me to create a website for their business and list their products and previous work on the website along with providing the user the ability to contact them where the user can ask for the products they are interested in. The thing I thought missing was for the business to understand the needs of the user clearly as in a message, the user might not easily explain the products they are interested in. I suggested to the client to integrate a cart system without having the user to sign in or create an account and then send the message to the business with the information of the products they are interested in as a part of their cart. So, the business can understand the needs of the user easily and can better serve them. The client was happy with the idea and I implemented the cart system and the contact form. The platform was successfully developed and the client was happy with the results.
